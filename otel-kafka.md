Yes ‚Äî you can **specifically enable SLF4J (backed by Logback or Log4j2) debug logging** for just your library by setting a log level for **your library‚Äôs package** in `application.yml` or `application.properties`.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-step: Enable Debug Logging for Your Library

### 1. ‚úÖ Set your logger name based on your **package structure**

Suppose your library is under:

```java
package com.yourcompany.telemetry.kafka;
```

You can enable DEBUG logging just for that package:

### ‚û§ In `application.yml`:

```yaml
logging:
  level:
    com.yourcompany.telemetry.kafka: DEBUG
```

### ‚û§ Or in `application.properties`:

```properties
logging.level.com.yourcompany.telemetry.kafka=DEBUG
```

---

### 2. üîç What This Does

This will:

* Set the log level to `DEBUG` **only for classes in that package**
* Leave the rest of your application logs (e.g. Spring Boot, Kafka client, OTEL SDK) at their default levels (e.g. `INFO` or `WARN`)
* Work across any Spring Boot app that imports your library

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Bonus: Make Sure You're Using SLF4J in Your Library

In your library:

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class OtelKafkaTracingAutoConfiguration {
    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(OtelKafkaTracingAutoConfiguration.class);

    public void someMethod() {
        log.debug("Registering Kafka interceptor for OTEL");
    }
}
```

As long as you use SLF4J, this will work with whatever backend (Logback, Log4j2) the consuming app is using.

---

### üß™ Optional: Add Logging to Confirm Activation

You can also do:

```java
@PostConstruct
public void debugActivation() {
    log.debug("[OTEL-KAFKA] Auto-configuration loaded and active");
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ TL;DR

To debug **only your library**, set:

```yaml
logging:
  level:
    com.yourcompany.telemetry.kafka: DEBUG
```

No need to touch global log level or add custom logger config.

Let me know if you want a temporary toggleable flag (e.g. `otel.debug=true`) to control log level programmatically.
