### **What is Kubernetes?**
**Kubernetes** (aka **K8s**) is an **open-source container orchestration platform**. It automates:

- Deployment  
- Scaling  
- Networking  
- Load balancing  
- Health checks  
- Rollouts and rollbacks  

...for containerized applications (usually Docker containers).

### **Core Concepts of Kubernetes**
- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit; can contain one or more containers.
- **Service**: Exposes Pods for access (internally or externally).
- **Deployment**: Declarative management for Pods, allowing rolling updates, scaling, etc.
- **Cluster**: A set of worker nodes managed by a control plane.
- **Node**: A VM or physical machine that runs Pods.
- **Namespace**: Logical separation within a cluster for multi-tenant environments.

### **Kubernetes on AWS**

#### 1. **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**
AWSâ€™s fully managed Kubernetes service. It removes the hassle of setting up and running your own Kubernetes control plane.

**Key features:**
- Fully managed **control plane** (API server, etcd, etc.)
- **Integration with IAM**, VPC, CloudWatch, ALB/ELB, and more
- Supports **Fargate** for serverless Pods (no need to manage EC2 nodes)

#### 2. **Running Kubernetes Yourself**
You can also self-manage Kubernetes on AWS by:
- Manually setting up EC2 instances
- Installing Kubernetes using **kubeadm** or **kops**
- Managing networking, scaling, upgrades manually

### **How Kubernetes and AWS Work Together**
| Kubernetes Concept | AWS Service Integration |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Nodes              | EC2 Instances or Fargate |
| LoadBalancers      | ELB / ALB                |
| Persistent Storage | EBS / EFS                |
| Secrets            | Secrets Manager / SSM    |
| Networking         | VPC / CNI plugin         |
| Logging/Monitoring | CloudWatch               |
| IAM                | Fine-grained Pod roles   |

### **When to Use Kubernetes on AWS**
Use **EKS** if:
- You want to containerize microservices
- You need portability across cloud providers
- You prefer open-source tooling
- You have complex orchestration needs (auto-scaling, rolling deploys, etc.)

If you're all-in on AWS but want a simpler experience, **ECS** (Elastic Container Service) might be enough.
